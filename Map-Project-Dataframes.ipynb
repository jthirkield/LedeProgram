Respondents, in fact, acknowledge that a direct causation standard applies, sometimes, but not always. Their two-teared suggestion, however, does not provide concrete guidance to the district courts and it would inevitably lead to the expansion of the inherent authority. One of the reasons this Court has been reticent about any sort of broadening of the scope of the inherent authority is because the due-process issues and separation of powers issues combined with a court determining the violation acting essentially as prosecutor and fact finder and then imposing the  penalty.

And that's the language that the Ninth Circuit said, we're -- we're going to -- we believe that the whole thing was a sham. And so to use a train analogy, most sanction cases involved misconduct that merely delays the train or perhaps ultimately -- you know, causes a detour. But ultimately, that train arrives at the intended station. In this case, the -- what the district court found, and which the Ninth Circuit agreed, was that the train jumped track and it went in an entirely wrong direction. It didn't even try the case that the claims that -- that my clients had. It -- it tried the case based on a false set of facts and never, ever -- it was never because the misconduct was never discovered during the course of this litigation, it was a completely empty charade. It didn't try the real facts of this case. It tried what Goodyear allowed us to have only.

I've got to put you back in the position you were before you started down, jumped track, and went in the wrong direction completely. And that's what she awarded.

How crucial was this evidence to that central issue? What was the impact of not having that? I think all of those are the types of factual determinations that we want district court judges to make.
