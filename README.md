# Data and Databases

Columbia University, Lede Program

Tuesdays and Thursdays, May 23th 2016 through July 7th 2017, 10am

[Jonathan Thirkield](http://www.floatingmedia.com/), instructor.

## Description

Working with data and databases requires not only gaining fluency in coding languages, but developing the ability to understand the particular structures and logics of the information space in which data exists. Through the introduction of the database language/application postgreSQL and the programming language Python, we will explore the varieties data types, structures and architectures along with the modes of thinking and kinds of knowledge that flow from working with data. Programmatically, this course will follow the path of data from storage (database building & architecture), to processing (query & transformation), to dissemination (streaming & application building). Conceptually, we will examine and discuss the process of developing data for machine and human readability: from developing taxonomies for understanding and structuring data sets, to ways in which data can be employed and disseminated as a means of storytelling. As we go, we will consider the the kinds of knowledge we are producing as well as the social, ethical, and practical challenges of searching for meaning in a haystack of bits. 


## Homework assignments

The detailed homework assignments and weekly syllabus has been migrated to Columbia's courseworks site, please login to courseworks for updated details. These github pages will still host updated course files, but I encourage you to use courseworks for that as well.
