# Data and Databases

Columbia University, Lede Program

Tuesdays and Thursdays, May 23th 2016 through July 7th 2017, 10am

[Jonathan Thirkield](http://www.floatingmedia.com/), instructor.

Office hours: By appointment only.

For FERPA reasons, I ask that you e-mail me [at my Columbia
address](mailto:jt599@columbia.edu) when discussing any matters related to
this class or your grade. Personal or professional inquiries can go to [my
personal address](mailto:jthirkield@gmail.com).

## Description

Working with data and databases requires not only gaining fluency in coding languages, but developing the ability to understand the particular structures and logics of the information space in which data exists. Through the introduction of the database language/application postgreSQL and the programming language Python, we will explore the varieties data types, structures and architectures along with the modes of thinking and kinds of knowledge that flow from working with data. Programmatically, this course will follow the path of data from storage (database building & architecture), to processing (query & transformation), to dissemination (streaming & application building). We
will study several common metaphors for organizing and storing data â€“ from
structureless key-value stores, to a single table or spreadsheet, to the
"multiple tables" of a relational database.  We will also discuss ideas behind
publishing or sharing data, moving from HTML documents and Web 1.0 to data
services and APIs in Web 2.0, to semantics in Web 3.0. As we go, we will consider the the kinds of knowledge we are producing as well as the social, ethical, and practical challenges of searching for meaning in a haystack of bits. 


## Homework assignments

There will be six homework assignments in this class, each assigned on Thursday
and due the following Tuesday before the beginning of class. The homework
assignments are designed to test and expand your knowledge of the technical
concepts introduced in class. Each homework assignment is worth 10% of your grade.

With the exception of the first one, all homework assignments will take the form of
an IPython Notebook that you fill in and send to a TA for grading. (We'll
discuss the specifics of this in class.)

## Grading

- 40% Attendance and participation
- 60% Homework assignments (10% each)

## Schedule and notes

### Week 1 (May 23 and 25)

* Orientation
* Student introductions
* SQL basics

Homework #1 (due May 30): Read and respond to the following.

* [The Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf)
  by Jorge Luis Borges

* [Relational and Non-Relational Models in the Entextualization of Bureaucracy](http://computationalculture.net/article/relational-and-non-relational-models-in-the-entextualization-of-bureaucracy)
  by Michael Castelle

The primary challenge when first working with database applications is to retool your mind so you are able to imagine how to see/understand how the database works in the essentially invisible space of computer memory. The Catelle's essay is a practical, historical, and theoretical introduction to the rise of the relational database. The Borges' story from 1934 is often cited along with other works by Borges' (such as "The Garden of Forking Paths") as a prophetic imagining of the Internet. How close was Borges to accurately predict the database? This is an open question, story wasn't trying to predict anything, but instead was imagining a metaphorical space for storing an infinite amount information.

Read the Borges first, and then, as you read Castelle's essay, search for parts that evoke, align with, and/or contradict passages from Borges. These connections can be as literal or Impressionistic as you want them to be. Find between three and five connections between the two texts and for each connection write a brief paragraph describing how discovered and understand the overlap between the two. Your response should take the form of a brief e-mail [sent to me](mailto:jt599@columbia.edu).
