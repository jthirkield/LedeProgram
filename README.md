## Description

Working with data and databases requires not only gaining fluency in coding languages, but developing the ability to understand the particular structures and logics of the information space in which data exists. Through the introduction of the database language/application postgreSQL and the programming language Python, we will explore the varieties data types, structures and architectures along with the modes of thinking and kinds of knowledge that flow from working with data. Programmatically, this course will follow the path of data from storage (database building & architecture), to processing (query & transformation), to dissemination (streaming & application building). Conceptually, we will examine and discuss the process of developing data for machine and human readability: from developing taxonomies for understanding and structuring data sets, to ways in which data can be employed and disseminated as a means of storytelling. As we go, we will consider the the kinds of knowledge we are producing as well as the social, ethical, and practical challenges of searching for meaning in a haystack of bits. 


## Homework assignments

There will be five homework assignments in this class and one final project. 
The assignments will be posted on Thursday and due by class time the following Tuesday. The homework
assignments are designed to test and expand your knowledge of the technical
concepts introduced in class. Each homework assignment is worth 10% of your grade.

With the exception of the first one, all homework assignments will take the form of
an IPython Notebook that you fill in and send to a TA for grading. (We'll
discuss the specifics of this in class.)

## Grading

- 30% Attendance and participation
- 50% 5 Homework assignments (10% each)
- 20% Final project

## Schedule and notes

### Week 1 (May 23 and 25)

* SQL basics

Homework #1 (due May 30): Read and respond to the following.

* [The Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf)
  by Jorge Luis Borges

* [Relational and Non-Relational Models in the Entextualization of Bureaucracy](http://computationalculture.net/article/relational-and-non-relational-models-in-the-entextualization-of-bureaucracy)
  by Michael Castelle

The primary challenge when first working with database applications is to retool your mind so you are able to imagine how to see/understand how the database works in the essentially invisible space of computer memory. The Catelle's essay is a practical, historical, and theoretical introduction to the rise of the relational database. The Borges' story from 1934 is often cited along with other works by Borges' (such as "The Garden of Forking Paths") as a prophetic imagining of the Internet. How close was Borges to accurately predict the database? This is an open question, story wasn't trying to predict anything, but instead was imagining a metaphorical space for storing an infinite amount information.

Read the Borges first, and then, as you read Castelle's essay, search for parts that evoke, align with, and/or contradict passages from Borges. These connections can be as literal or Impressionistic as you want them to be. Find between three and five connections between the two texts and for each connection write a brief paragraph describing how discovered and understand the overlap between the two. Your response should take the form of a brief e-mail [sent to me](mailto:jt599@columbia.edu).
