    "## Working with Leaflet.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaflet.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to make interactive maps that includes shapes, markers, pop-up windows and many other built-in interactive capabilities. But, because it's written in JavaScript and running the browser, anyone with knowledge of JavaScript can extend its capabilities as far as that knowledge can take them. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is most important to us is that \"data\" can be attached to these maps via geojson format--making the map, and the rest of the browser an interface for the reader to explore and engage with the output of your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your final projects--the real goal is producing successful, thoughtful, meaningful **output** that can be discovered through the map. More on the specific output you'll need in a moment: first, in basics about JavaScript and leaflet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript\n",
    "JavaScript is the programming language that was invented in order to make webpages interactive. JavaScript is an odd and quirky language--it began as a necessity for scripting events on web browsers, and now it has been extended in many directions beyond even the browser. There are many JavaScript tutorials out there -- https://www.w3schools.com/js/ is the most basic, and a decent place to start. With your knowledge of Python you could certainly learned JavaScript via tutorials, books like \"Javascript & JQuery, interactive front-end web development, by Jon Duckett\", sites/books like http://eloquentjavascript.net/, and, of course, by patrolling stack overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few basic things to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "-All lines in JavaScript are supposed to end with the semi-colon  `;`\n",
    "Not everyone follows this standard, but that's what you're supposed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "-All functions, loops, if statements etc. are enclosed in brackets `{ }`\n",
    "For example, here's a JavaScript loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "for (var i=0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
    "console.log(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the console.log(), that is JavaScript version of print. The runtime environment for JavaScript is the browser. The console is the JavaScript console that is part of the browser's developer tools. Go to Chrome and select \n",
    "\n",
    "`View:Developer:JavaScript Console`\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can cut-and-paste that loop into the console and run it. The console is very helpful for debugging JavaScript. When you have errors on the the page, the console tells you where they are (or tries to), and you can also log variables into the console to make sure everything is working in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more to now about JavaScript, if you want to learn it. Here a few random things to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Indentations are meaningless in JavaScript (but it's good to use them to your code can be read clearly by a human)\n",
    "\n",
    "-JavaScript is a messy language, it tries not to be type-specific: so it will automatically convert numerical variables into strings and back--unless it doesn't.\n",
    "-JavaScript tries not to break--if one part of the script breaks it tries to keep the page going, so sometimes it's hard to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "-JavaScript cares about the DOM -- it reads the page for elements and allows you to change their contents, styles, and lots of other things. For really robust browser-page effects, you should use the Jquery library--it's like superpowered JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "-As I'm sure you all know by now, \"lists\" in Python are \"arrays\" in JavaScript, \"dictionaries\" in Python are \"objects\" in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Finally: **you do not need to learn JavaScript to complete this project.** I have built I A few templates that will allow you to build a geojson file that should plugged to the leaflet.js Page with only a little bit of work and custom changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCREEN SPACE\n",
    "The space on the browser, and the whole screen are measured on an X/Y axis. Good thing to know, I'll explain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### CUSTOM CHANGES\n",
    "To make your leaflet project work, you only need to make some small changes on the HTML page (your main goal is generating the proper output for geojson--I'll get to that soon). First here are a few things that you can do to the HTML/leaflet code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Center your map and choose your zoom:\n",
    "\n",
    "`var map = L.map('map').setView([37.8, -96], 4);`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first JavaScript variable that you will see as the map is constructed. `L.` means you're using the leaflet library to build this map. More importantly `.setView()` tells the browser what latitude and longitude you want the map to be centered on `[37.8, -96]`, and the next number is the zoom level `4)`. 0 is the whole world, around 12 you start zooming in on a city, after 20 you start getting very very close to the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose your tiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "`id: 'mapbox.light'`\n",
    "\n",
    "This line lets you access a free tile library from MapBox, are other free tiles include:\n",
    "\n",
    "`mapbox.dark, mapbox.streets, mapbox.satellite`\n",
    "\n",
    "Full list: https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#maps\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do some searching for others if you'd like--some cost money, some you can design yourself, but you don't have time for that right now. (Also note: we are using the default access token from the leaflet tutorials--if you want to get more serious about this, I recommend that you get your own axis token.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the super basics--you can go a lot deeper on your own if you want to pursue this project beyond the next two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OUTPUT!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this is really what matters the next 10 days. You're now scraping cleaning and aggregating your data. The question will be, **what do you want people to see?** Here are the main categories need to focus on in order to get the output you need.  All of these outputs will be constructed in Python, and exported to geojson.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometry**\n",
    "This is critical to building your GEOJSON object--what kind of geometry will you need. There're two aspects of geometry you need to decide on--first what geographical level are you studying (Country, State, City, Address), and second, what kind of shape do you need? Most of you will need polygons and multi polygons Country/ State level projects. A few of you we'll need points (which is simple latitude and longitude). Here is Leaflet's tutorial on shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/\n",
    "\n",
    "While geometry is critical, at this point you only need to know which kind of geometry you'll need--the last step of your project should be locating shape files and merging them with your output data that will all be in the \"properties\" object/dictionary of your final geojson document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:** This is what you should be focusing on building. As you will see there're only about four or five Dictionary keys that you need to build. But you need to build them well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**name:** State/ Country/ City--the main unit of study\n",
    "**code:** State/ Country/ City--the main unit of study\n",
    "\n",
    "**color:** in a hexadecimal (\"#660066\") or RGB (\"rgb(120,0,120)\") string -- for more when defining colors, check this out: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/\n",
    "Think about how many colors do you need, and what kind of colors would be the most representative, appropriate, effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**lede:** a simple short summary of the information attached to the layer (State/City/Point)--like a headline. This will appear in the pop-up window when you roll over a later\n",
    "\n",
    "**article:** text displayed in the browser, outside of the map--this can be an entire article in HTML. This text will be displayed when you click on a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**group:** different groupings of data to be displayed separately as multiple layers on the map--this will allow you to display/study multiple aspects of the data.\n"
