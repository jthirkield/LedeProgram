    "The major challenge of the BBC project is to transform the list of critics and movies into searchable Python lists and/or dictionaries. The most difficult aspect of this project is the first: scraping the page on the BBC and, using beautiful soup and regular expressions, building a data set that will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the data set, you will be in good shape going forward--the goal after that will be to search for interesting patterns (top movies by country/critic/director/year)--this is the conceptual work you need to be thinking about while you struggle through wrangling your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do I wrangle this data? That is the central challenge that you'll be dealing with through Wednesday of this week. The HTML page on the BBC site poses a number of challenges. While the layout is relatively simple and consistent--the simplicity actually makes it a little bit harder, because there's not that many HTML tags to help you isolate each unit of data--you can use beautiful soup to isolate the line that contains all the information for the critic, and you can isolate each group of top 10 movies as well. You need to, and this is a bit harder, use beautiful soup find the critic--as well as the list of movies then immediately follow her/him. (Using beautiful soup to do that is challenging--I have instructions on how to figure it out, but if you can't figure it out--just email me and I will send you the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that is how this process will work--below I have step-by-step instructions so you can try to write the code yourself. Do your best--and if you can't get there, email me and I will send you working code so you can move on to the next step.\n"

This is something you need to search for on your own--it will be hard for you to find a single page that has a list of every single director. But see what you can find. In the end, you don't have to have a complete database of every single director, but do your best to get as many as you can.\n"

    "So each list would contain 13 elements -- three entries about the critic, and then the 10 movies picked. critics_list[0][3] would be the first critic's #1 movie, critics_list[2][12] would be the third critic's  #10 movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you would make  **\"movie_list\"** which would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`movie_list = [['movie name','director name','movie date'],['movie name','director name','movie date']]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Just go through the whole page and make a list of lists for every movie. Each list would contain three elements. movie_list[0][0] what give you the name of the first movie in the list, movie_list[3][1] would give you the director of the fourth movie in the list.\n",
    "\n",
